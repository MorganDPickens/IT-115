# IT-115 Final Project

Presentation due: 12/7/23
Project Overview
Your group will fork a copy of the Cloud Code Camp "websitedemoLinks to an external site.". Once you get your fork, you will turn this set of files into your own version of Web Site Demo.  Suggested changes include:

adding new content to the demo
changing themes and styles on the demo
replacing demo content with your own content
anything you want to, really, as long as the demo continues to feature multiple web pages with scripts and styles
The fork will never go back to the main repository on https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/websitedemoLinks to an external site.. You only have download rights to that repository. Instead, your group needs to create your own repository with its own new main branch for your group's version of the web site demo . You can reuse, edit, modify, delete, or do anything you want to with the seed code you get from https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/websitedemoLinks to an external site..
